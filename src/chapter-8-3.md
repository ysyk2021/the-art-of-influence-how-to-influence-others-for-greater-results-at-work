Influencing across boundaries can be challenging, particularly when navigating complex politics and power dynamics. In this chapter, we'll explore strategies for effectively influencing stakeholders in these situations.

Understanding Politics and Power Dynamics

To effectively influence across boundaries, individuals must first understand the politics and power dynamics at play. This involves identifying key players, understanding their motivations and interests, and recognizing any formal or informal power structures that may impact influence efforts. By understanding politics and power dynamics, individuals can develop strategies for building alliances and overcoming potential barriers to influence.

Building Alliances
