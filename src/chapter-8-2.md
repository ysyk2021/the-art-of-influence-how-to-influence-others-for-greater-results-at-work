Understanding Boundaries

By building networks, individuals can gain insights into different perspectives and needs, and identify opportunities for collaboration and partnership.

Developing Partnerships

Developing partnerships is another important strategy for influencing across boundaries. This involves working collaboratively with colleagues and stakeholders to achieve shared goals and objectives. Effective partnerships require trust, mutual respect, and clear communication and expectations. By developing partnerships, individuals can leverage resources and expertise from different areas of the organization or industry, and achieve greater impact and results.
